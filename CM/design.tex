\section{Introduction}

This document discusses the design of several concurrent data
structures. Both an advanced design and a discussion about the
expected performance will be given for each data structure.

The data structures are the following: CoarseGrainedList,
CoarseGrainedTree, FineGrainedList, FineGrainedTree,
LockFreeList and LockFreeTree.

The difficulty with these data structures is that they are
accessed by several threads concurrently, so mutual exclusion has
to be provided for the parts where the updates take place.

\section{CoarseGrainedList}

The first data structure discussed is the CoarseGrainedList.
This is a singly-linked list. When an element is added or removed,
the entire data structure is locked.

\subsection{Design}

Design of CGL.

\subsection{Performance}

Performance Evaluation of CGL.

\section{CoarseGrainedTree}

The CoarseGrainedTree is a binary search tree. As with the
CoarseGrainedList, the complete data structure is locked when
a add or remove is performed.

\subsection{Design}

Design of CGT.

\subsection{Performance}

Performance Evaluation of CGT.

\section{FineGrainedList}

The FineGrainedList is a linked list that only locks a part of
the data structure when performing an add or remove operation. This
gives it the ability to have several threads update the list at the
same time.

\subsection{Design}

Design of FGL.

\subsection{Performance}

Performance Evaluation of FGL.

\section{FineGrainedTree}

The FineGrainedTree is a tree in which only a part of the data structure
will be locked for add or remove operations, as with the FineGrainedList.

\subsection{Design}

Design of FGT.

\subsection{Performance}

Performance Evaluation of FGT.

\section{LockFreeList}

The LockFreeList is a linked list that does not use a lock when updating
the datastructure. Instead it uses a single atomic operation for both
comparing and updating, compare-and-set instructions.

\subsection{Design}

Design of LFL.

\subsection{Performance}

Performance Evaluation of LFL.

\section{LockFreeTree}

The LockFreeTree uses compare-and-set instructions in stead of locks.

\subsection{Design}

Design of LFT.

\subsection{Performance}

Performance Evaluation of LFT.
