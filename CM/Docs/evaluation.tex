\section{Introduction}

This document discusses the design and performance of several
concurrent data structures.

The data structures are the following: CoarseGrainedList,
CoarseGrainedTree, FineGrainedList, FineGrainedTree,
LockFreeList and LockFreeTree.

The difficulty with these data structures is that they are accessed by several threads 
concurrently, so mutual exclusion has to be provided for the parts where the updates take 
place.

The design of the datastructures was already given in the design document\cite{design}, 
and will therefore only be discussed on a high level in this performance evaluation. Any
difficulties encountered during the implementation will be discussed.
