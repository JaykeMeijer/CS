\section{Introduction}

This document discusses the design and performance of several
concurrent data structures.

The data structures are the following: CoarseGrainedList,
CoarseGrainedTree, FineGrainedList, FineGrainedTree,
LockFreeList and LockFreeTree.

The difficulty with these data structures is that they are accessed by several threads
concurrently, so it has to be guaranteed that each update succeeds, even when separate
updates by different threads interfere.

The design of the data structures was already given in the design document\cite{design}.
These will therefore only be discussed on a high level in this performance evaluation. Any
difficulties encountered during the implementation will be discussed.

\section{Implementation difficulties}

\subsection{Lists and CoarseGrainedTree}
Most of the data structures were straightforward to implement. The CoarseGrainedList,
FineGrainedList and LockFreeList were described in the book by Herlihy and
Shavit\cite{book}. These did therefore not present any problems during the implementation.

The CoarseGrainedTree had to be designed by ourself, but only required the placing of a
lock mechanism around standard tree insertions and removals. The used algorithms for
inserting and removing in a Binary Search Tree are based on standard BST operations.
\cite{insert}\cite{delete}

\subsection{FineGrainedTree}

The FineGrainedTree is more of a challenge to implement. The basic idea is the same as the
FineGrainedList. It uses hand-over-hand locking to traverse through the list. However,
instead of locking the successor you first have to determine whether to lock the left or
the right child node.

The challenge is what to do during the removal of an element. When deleting a node that
has two children, the in-order successor of this node has to be found. This is the node
with the smallest value in the right subtree of the node to delete. However, it is
possible that another thread is performing an operation in this subtree. Therefore
traversal through this subtree should be done with locking as well, to prevent overtaking
of another thread.

\subsection{LockFreeTree}

The most challenging data structure is the LockFreeTree. The design is provided in an
article by Ellen, Ruppert, Fatourou and Van Breugel.\cite{lft} This article describes the
algorithms, gives a pseudocode implementation and proves why it is correct.

The first challenge encountered is that the article uses Compare-And-Swap instructions.
However, Java does not have this operation, it only supports Compare-And-Set instructions.
The difference between these two is that a Compare-And-Swap returns the original value,
even when the operation failed. The Compare-And-Set only returns whether the operation
succeeded or not.

This is potentially a problem in the \texttt{HelpDelete()} function, where the result of
the CAS operation is not only used to check whether the operation succeeded, but is also
used for another check where it is verified if the node is marked. However, in this
case we can argue that this is not a problem. One of the properties of the design is that
a marked node will never be unmarked or changed. Therefore, if a node is marked, no
further checks have to be atomic and can be performed without any harm.

Another challenge is that the article stores the \texttt{Update} field in a single CAS
word, and uses a part of this word for the state(only 2 bits) and the rest for the pointer
to the info record. However, this kind of storage is not possible in Java. The solution is
to use the \texttt{AtomicStampedReference<V>} class. This can store a reference to an
object and an integer. The integer can be used to store the state, while the reference
points to an info object. Both can be read and updated in a single atomic step by
\texttt{get()} and \texttt{compareAndSet()} respectively.

Another challenge that we encountered is the \texttt{Search()} function. In the pseudocode
this function returns five variables. Java only supports the return of one variable, or
you have to create an array of one element, pass it on to the function as an argument and
store the return value in this argument. This would create rather messy code. Our solution
is to create an object, called \texttt{SearchTuple}. This contains the five values
returned by the search function. That function will now return a SearchTuple.

There is one thing to be aware of with this construction. The pseudocode search function
uses \texttt{gpupdate} and \texttt{pupdate} both internally and as return values. However,
in Java this makes it a reference to the \emph{update} field of the node found. This means
it can be changed by another thread. However, the result returned by search (ie the
searchTuple) should never change. Therefore the \texttt{pupdate} and \texttt{gpupdate} are
cloned in the constructor of the searchTuple, so they do not point to the update field of
a node but to a new, unique, update object.

\section{Performance Evaluation}

\subsection{Hardware}

The tests have been performed on two different systems. The first is a server
at the VU, reachable at \url{fluit.few.vu.nl}. This machine has eight cores and
is suitable for true parallelism testing. However, due to the high usage on
this machine, the performance figures are not reliable. This machine is only
used to verify that the data structures work even when a large number of
threads are operating concurrently.

The actual performance tests are done on a machine with an AMD 955 CPU
(quad-core, 3.2GHz), running Xubuntu 12.04.1 LTS.

\subsection{Evaluation}

The figures in appendix \ref{app:vary_nelements} shows that the runtime of the
list structures grows exponentially as the number of elements increases, while
the runtime of the tree structures grows linearly.

As expected, the coarse-grained data structures perform better than the
fine-grained and lock-free data structures on a single thread (figure
\ref{fig:threads_1}), because the overhead of locks and atomic operations is
smaller. This is still the case when using two threads. Starting at four
threads (figure \ref{fig:threads_4}), the lock-free implementations become the
best performing data structures. The FineGrainedList performs worse than the
CoarseGrainedList and the LockFreeList in almost all cases, except on a single
thread, where the LockFreeList is the slowest. This means that on a single
thread, the overhead of atomic operations is larger than the overhead of
fine-grained locking. The design document predicted that the FineGrainedList
would not perform very good, because of the change of ``congestions'' (when one
thread is waiting for another to release a lock before continuing traversal).
The LockFreeList was expected to scale very well with the number of threads,
which is indeed the case (as opposed to the other list implementations).

Furthermore, the overhead caused by fine-grained locking in a list structure
seems to be killing for its performance. The CoarseGrainedList performs better
than the FineGrainedList in all measurements. In the design document, we
estimated this overhead to be much smaller, and thus that the FineGrainedList
would perform better than the CoarseGrainedList. The measurements show that
this is not the case, and that the overhead of fine-locking should be taken
into account when designing a concurrent data structure. In fact, The
CoarseGrainedList performs better than expected due to a small amount of
locking overhead.

The measured performance of the tree implementations fit the expectations from
the design document. The CoarseGrainedTree performs best on one or two threads
due to the absence of overhead from locking and atomic operations. On a larger
number of threads, however, the advantage of the concurrent tree traversal by
the FineGrainedTree and LockFreeTree is clearly visible. The runtime of each
tree implementation still grows linearly, but those of the LockFreeTree and
FineGrainedTree increase at a lower rate than the CoarseGrainedTree. This is
consistent with the expectation from the design document, namely that the
advantage of the FineGrainedList as opposed to the CoarseGrainedList would grow
with the size of the list.

The design document also raises the expectation that the LockFreeTree and
FineGrainedTree would basically perform much better than the CoarseGrainedTree
due to the absence of a global lock. However, fine-grained locks and atomic
operations seem to cause more significant overhead than expected. It must be
noted that we have only performed the measurements on a quad-core machine,
whereas the difference between coarse-grained locking and
fine-grained/lock-free implementations grow with the number of concurrent
threads. Therefore, a 16-core machine will probably show a greater advantage of
the latter two data structures.

The runtime of the LockFreeTree increases at a lower rate than the
FineGrainedTree. This means that the use of atomic operations is less costly
(performance-wise) than fine-grained locking. This seems to contradict the
better performance of the FineGrainedList as opposed to the LockFreeList on a
single thread, which we discussed earlier. However, there is an explanation:
On a single thread, the FineGrainedList only suffers from overhead of taking a
lock and releasing it again. On two or more threads, the threads will
some times have to wait for others threads to release a lock. The LockFreeList
only has the overhead of atomic operations, which is on itself larger than the
overhead caused by the act of taking and releasing a lock. However, threads in
a lock-free environment will by definition never have to wait for other
threads, thus the overhead is constant with respect to the number of threads.

\subsubsection*{Memory overhead in LockFreeTree}

Because the LockFreeTree stores values only in leaf nodes, traversal is more
costly than in the other trees. In the design document, we expected that the
this might cause some overhead when the tree contains large number of elements
(more nodes to traverse through as opposed to the other trees), on a small
number of threads (less advantage of wait-free concurrency). The figures in
appendix \ref{app:vary_nthreads} confirm this expectation: using one or two
threads, the CoarseGrainedTree performs a small amount better than the
LockFreeTree.

\subsubsection*{Locking overhead on more than four threads}

The shape of the graphs in appendix \ref{app:vary_nthreads} show a clear
pattern: The runtimes of all tree structures first decrease up to four threads.
On more threads, the runtimes of the lock-based trees increase again, which
seems strange at first sight. This can be explained by the fact that the
measurements were performed on a quad-core machine. Up to four threads, the
system schedules each thread to run on a separate core, this maximizing
performance at four threads. Using more than four threads, processors have to
constantly switch between different threads. Not only is this an expensive
operation, but it also comes with the possibility of some thread which is
holding the lock being suspended, which will block all other threads waiting
for that lock as well.
